Project week
============

During the project week you will use what you have learned during the lectures
and hands-on exercises.

Ideally this will be to introduce version control, testing, documentation
framework, good practices and good intentions for your own project(s). If you
use makefiles then the project can also involve moving to CMake (we highly
recommend such a step).

You should choose and submit a short project abstract (one or two paragraphs)
in pdf format before the end of day 4 so that we have the possibility to
discuss the projects on day 5.

The project work concludes with a report summarizing the work done. You don't
have to write a novel, 3-5 pages should do it. Describe the situation before
and after. Describe what you did and how everything works together in your
project(s). It is OK to write this report online - then other developers have
the possibility to follow your good example and you also document routines and
workflows for new developers that want to join your project(s).
