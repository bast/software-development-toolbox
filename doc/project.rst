Project week
============

During the project week you will use what you have learned during the lectures
and hands-on exercises.

Ideally this will be to introduce version control, testing, documentation
framework, good practices and good intentions for your own project(s). If you
use makefiles then the project can also involve moving to CMake (we highly
recommend such a step).

You should choose and submit a short project abstract (one or two paragraphs)
in pdf format before the end of day 4 so that we have the possibility to
discuss the projects.

The project work should conclude with a report. You don't have to write a
novel, 3-5 pages should do it. Describe the situation before and after.
Describe what you did and how everything works together in your project(s). It
is OK to write this report online - then other developers have the possibility
to follow your good example and you also document routines for new developers
that want to join your project(s).
