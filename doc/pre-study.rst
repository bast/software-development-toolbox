Pre-study week
==============

During the pre-study week you should acquire basics in at least one interpreted
language in case you have never used one (we recommend Python or Julia) and
basics in at least one compiled language in case you have never used one (we
recommend C or C++ or Fortran). But if you prefer Ruby to Python then there is
nothing wrong with that. And if you are interested in learning Haskell or
Clojure or F# as contrast to "traditional" languages for scientific programs,
then please do - this course is in principle language-independent.

The reason why we recommend to learn an interpreted and a compiled language
during the pre-study week is that we will not teach programming languages but
we will teach tools and work-flows for an efficient collaborative programming.
We believe that developers who use compiled languages can benefit from
interpreted languages and vice versa. Typically you will anyway end up using
several programming languages.

We also recommend to study the basics of version control using Git. This will
be treated during the lectures as well but it will help to already have a basic
idea.
