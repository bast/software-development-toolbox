Overview
========

We have 3 exercise sessions and 4 exercise groups.  Everybody should complete
at least 3 exercise groups. You can of course try to complete all of them. We
will all start with Git. Python-only programmers can skip the CMake exercise
(which is really only interesting for compiled projects).  Preferably work in
groups of two and discuss but if you prefer you can also tackle the exercises
on your own. For the CMake, testing, and documentation exercises it is
perfectly fine to use own programs instead of mockup examples.
